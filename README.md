These are the before and after results of implementing NIST 800-53: SC-7 security compliance hardening on the honeynet environment. There is a 100% improvement in nearly all incident alerts except for SecurityAlert for which there is an nearly 89% improvement.

However, I believe these results are moreso due to the implementation of greater security measures out of the box by Microsoft themselves behind the scenes instead of the NIST800-53: SC-7 hardening, though I have no way of proving this. More trials of the project would be needed to see if this is the case. But I can say the before/after results are supposed to be less dramatic.
